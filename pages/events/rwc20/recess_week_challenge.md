**3DC Recess Week Challenge** is a great way to kill off spare time, or to learn a new skill during this recess week! Follow through our Minecraft-themed story to learn to do some basic coding, solve algorithm questions, try out your hand at deploying a cloud-based web application, compete in a time-based coding challenge and win prizes!

## Timeline

The 3DC recess week challenge comprises three main parts:

1. Cloud-based lab to deploy a simple web application with REST API (24/10/20)
2. Daily Hackerrank own-time-own-target coding challenge (26/10/20 - 28/10/20)
3. Time-based coding challenge on Hackerrank (30/10/20)

You do not have to complete the challenges or labs on the day they are released. Just submit them before the **deadline on 31/10/20 1500 (Saturday).** However, those who complete the time-based coding challenge faster will rank higher, so try to start working on that challenge as soon as it is released!

## Prizes

**1st Place**: Raspberry Pi Model 4B+ 4GB RAM

Prize for **Top 5 Freshmore Students**: $5 GrabFood Voucher each  
Prize for **Top 5 Non-ISTD Pillar-Year Students**: $5 GrabFood Voucher each
